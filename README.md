I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin Madison, graduating this May. 

Before my master’s, I worked as a Software Engineer at Mastercard for about two years. I worked on backend and production systems in the payments domain, where I dealt with real production issues, reliability problems, and systems that needed to be correct and stable at scale.

During my master’s, I’ve focused heavily on systems work. Most of my projects are in C and C++ and are centered around low level systems. I’m broadly interested in systems engineering, especially database internals, distributed systems, storage systems, operating systems, and high performance computing. I enjoy working close to the system, understanding performance and correctness tradeoffs, and building things that are meant to run reliably in production.

I’m currently looking for a Spring co-op as well as full-time software engineering roles starting June. I’m most interested in backend, systems, infrastructure, database, or storage focused teams where I can work on real systems and continue growing as a systems engineer.
